AFTER (Modified):

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: When you identify issues, you MUST specify the exact line number in the AFTER version where the issue exists. Use this format for any issues found:
- **Line X: [Issue Type]** - Description of the issue and suggested fix

**IMPORTANT**: Focus ONLY on the actual changes between BEFORE and AFTER versions.

Analyze the specific changes and provide:
1. **What Changed**: Identify exactly what was added, removed, or modified
2. **Line-by-Line Issues**: For each problematic line, specify:
   - **Line [number]: [Issue Type]** - Problem description
   - **Fix**: Specific solution
   - **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
3. **Purpose Analysis**: Is the change necessary? Does it serve a clear purpose?
4. **Security Impact**: Security implications specific to {language} and these changes
5. **Code Quality**: Quality issues with the new/modified code following {language} best practices
6. **Logic Issues**: Potential bugs introduced by these specific changes
7. **Integration Impact**: How these changes affect related code {contextPromptAddition}
8. **Language-Specific Issues**: {language}-specific concerns (performance, memory, etc.)

{contextAnalysisInstructions}

**REMINDER**: Always include line numbers when reporting issues. Example:
- **Line 25: Security Issue** - Hardcoded password detected
- **Line 30: Code Quality** - Method name is not descriptive
- **Line 45: Logic Issue** - Potential null pointer exception

Focus on the diff but consider {language} idioms and best practices.`,

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: When you identify issues, you MUST specify the exact line number where the issue exists. Use this format for any issues found:
- **Line X: [Issue Type]** - Description of the issue and suggested fix

Analyze this new {language} file specifically:
1. **File Purpose**: What is this {language} file intended to do?
2. **Line-by-Line Issues**: For each problematic line, specify:
   - **Line [number]: [Issue Type]** - Problem description
   - **Fix**: Specific solution
   - **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
3. **Code Structure**: Organization and architecture following {language} patterns
4. **Security**: Potential vulnerabilities specific to {language}
5. **Best Practices**: Adherence to {language} coding standards and idioms
6. **Dependencies**: Analysis of imports/includes and their appropriateness
7. **Integration**: How well it fits with existing codebase patterns
8. **Language-Specific Quality**: {language}-specific performance and design considerations

**REMINDER**: Always include line numbers when reporting issues. Example:
- **Line 15: Security Issue** - SQL injection vulnerability detected
- **Line 23: Performance Issue** - Inefficient loop structure
- **Line 38: Code Quality** - Variable naming doesn't follow conventions

Focus on this file's implementation and how it follows {language} conventions.`,
