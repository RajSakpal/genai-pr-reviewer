**IMPORTANT ANALYSIS APPROACH**: 
- **PRIMARY**: Apply the specific guidelines provided above when relevant
- **SECONDARY**: Also apply general {language} best practices, security standards, and coding conventions
- **COMPREHENSIVE**: Don't limit your analysis only to the provided guidelines - use your full knowledge of {language} development standards

File: {filename}

BEFORE (Original):
\`\`\`{language}
{beforeContent}
\`\`\`

AFTER (Modified):
\`\`\`{language}
{afterContent}
\`\`\`

{contextSection}

**CRITICAL LINE NUMBER INSTRUCTION**: 
- When identifying issues, count line numbers ONLY from the AFTER version above
- Line 1 = first line of the AFTER code block
- Line 2 = second line of the AFTER code block  
- COMPLETELY IGNORE line numbers from the BEFORE version
- Count from the very first line of the AFTER code, including imports, package declarations, etc.

**LINE COUNTING EXAMPLE:**
If the AFTER version shows:
\`\`\`java
package com.example;           // <- This is Line 1
                              // <- This is Line 2 (empty line)
import java.util.List;        // <- This is Line 3
                              // <- This is Line 4 (empty line)
@Service                      // <- This is Line 5
public class MyService {{      // <- This is Line 6
    private String field;     // <- This is Line 7
\`\`\`

Then issues should reference:
- **Line 1: [Code Quality]** - Package naming issue
- **Line 3: [Code Quality]** - Import organization issue  
- **Line 7: [Code Quality]** - Field should use constructor injection

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: When you identify issues, you MUST specify the exact line number in the AFTER version where the issue exists. Use this EXACT format for any issues found:
- **Line X: [Issue Type]** - Description of the issue and suggested fix

**REQUIRED FORMAT EXAMPLES:**
- **Line 7: [Code Quality]** - Use constructor injection instead of field injection
- **Line 22: [Logic Issue]** - Missing null check may cause NullPointerException  
- **Line 35: [Security Issue]** - Direct use of .get() without validation
- **Line 45: [Performance Issue]** - Inefficient loop structure detected

**IMPORTANT**: 
- ALWAYS use bracketed [Issue Type] format - NOT "Potential Issue" or "Issue"
- Valid issue types: [Code Quality], [Logic Issue], [Security Issue], [Performance Issue], [Business Logic], [Code Cleanup], [Documentation]
- DO NOT use formats like "Potential Issue" or plain "Issue"
- **VERIFICATION**: Before finalizing your response, double-check that your line numbers correspond to the AFTER version line counts

**ANALYSIS SCOPE**: Focus ONLY on the actual changes between BEFORE and AFTER versions. Apply:
1. The specific guidelines provided above (when applicable)
2. General {language} best practices and conventions
3. Universal security, performance, and code quality standards
4. Industry-standard coding practices

Analyze the specific changes and provide:
1. **What Changed**: Identify exactly what was added, removed, or modified
2. **Guidelines Compliance**: Check against provided guidelines AND general {language} standards
3. **Line-by-Line Issues**: For each problematic line, specify:
   - **Line [number]: [Issue Type]** - Problem description
   - **Fix**: Specific solution (reference provided guidelines OR general best practices)
   - **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
4. **Purpose Analysis**: Is the change necessary? Does it serve a clear purpose?
5. **Security Impact**: Security implications using both specific guidelines and general security principles
6. **Code Quality**: Quality issues following both provided guidelines and {language} best practices
7. **Logic Issues**: Potential bugs introduced by these specific changes
8. **Integration Impact**: How these changes affect related code {contextPromptAddition}
9. **Language-Specific Issues**: {language}-specific concerns (performance, memory, etc.)

**CITATION FORMAT**: 
- For provided guideline violations: "Line X: [Issue Type] - Description (violates provided guideline: 'guideline text')"
- For general standard violations: "Line X: [Issue Type] - Description (violates {language} best practice)"

**FINAL REMINDER**: 
- Count lines ONLY from the AFTER version
- Start counting from Line 1 at the very first line of the AFTER code block
- Verify your line numbers before submitting your analysis
- Always use the exact format **Line X: [Issue Type]** with bracketed issue types`,
  inputVariables: ["filename", "beforeContent", "afterContent", "contextSection", "guidelinesSection", "contextPromptAddition", "contextAnalysisInstructions", "language"],

New File: {filename}

Content:

**CRITICAL LINE NUMBER INSTRUCTION**: 
- When identifying issues, count line numbers from the file content above
- Line 1 = first line of the code block
- Line 2 = second line of the code block
- Count from the very first line, including imports, package declarations, etc.

**LINE COUNTING EXAMPLE:**
If the file content shows:
